# vlain-jkr — Why so serious...?

**Hello, world.**

You've stumbled into my playground — a little lab of controlled chaos.  
Firewalls, intrusion detection, DNS traps, packet sniffers — all carefully designed to simulate madness in motion.

Some people just want to push packets.  
Me? I *watch the whole network burn,*  
then trace the ashes... with Suricata and Wireshark.

This is my profile.  
A place where defense meets deception.  
Where MITRE ATT&CK isn't just a framework — it's a punchline.

Now, let’s put a smile on that DNS query.

## 🛠️ Projects

### **[Pi-hole + Unbound Recursive DNS Resolver](https://github.com/vlain-jkr/pi-hole-unbound)**
Built and configured a secure DNS resolver using Pi-hole and Unbound with DNSSEC validation and DNS-over-TLS fallback. Hardened the setup to act as a privacy-focused, recursive DNS layer for home or lab networks.

**Skills**: DNS security, DNSSEC, Unbound configuration, Pi-hole, Linux system administration

---

### **[Virtual SOC (Security Operations Center)](https://github.com/vlain-jkr/virtual-soc)**
Created a virtual SOC using Kali Linux and Ubuntu, with centralized log collection and basic SIEM simulation. The lab includes log forwarding, alert testing, and simulated incident response workflows.

**Skills**: Log analysis, SOC workflow, Linux networking, VM deployment, security operations

---

### **[Suricata + MITRE ATT&CK Mapping](https://github.com/vlain-jkr/suricata-mitre)**
Deployed Suricata IDS and mapped alert signatures to MITRE ATT&CK techniques. Designed and tested rule sets to detect common adversary behaviors in a lab network environment.

**Skills**: Intrusion detection, Suricata, rule writing, threat intelligence, MITRE ATT&CK

---

### **[Wireshark Threat Analysis Lab](https://github.com/vlain-jkr/wireshark-threat-lab)**
Used Wireshark to capture and inspect network traffic from simulated threats. Investigated suspicious activity such as port scans, lateral movement, and command-and-control traffic.

**Skills**: Packet analysis, network forensics, Wireshark filters, PCAP analysis, threat hunting

---

### **[Defense-in-Depth Simulation Lab](https://github.com/vlain-jkr/defense-in-depth-lab)**
Designed a layered security lab with network segmentation, firewall rules (iptables/nftables), and log obfuscation. Simulated attacker behavior to test the effectiveness of monitoring and controls.

**Skills**: Defense-in-depth, Linux firewalling, network segmentation, log management, red vs. blue simulation

---

### **[Docker Honeynet + Suricata + Tailscale](https://github.com/vlain-jkr/docker-honeynet-lab)**
Launched a vulnerable container network (DVWA, Juice Shop, WebGoat) monitored by Suricata IDS and isolated via nftables. Access secured using Tailscale, simulating attacker traffic for alert tuning and log analysis.

**Skills**: Docker, honeypots, Suricata monitoring, network isolation, secure remote access

## 👤 About Me

I'm **Gunveer Singh**, but online I go by **vlain-jkr** — building out security labs where attackers roam and defenders respond.

I experiment with deception, intrusion detection, and defense-in-depth strategies in contained, replicable environments. My work focuses on **understanding attack behaviors** and crafting **layered defenses** that reveal more than they block.

Explore, fork, test, break things — or reach out if you want to collaborate.

🕶️ Defense is an art. Let’s make it a little theatrical.
