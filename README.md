# vlain-jkr ‚Äî Why so serious...?

**Hello, world.**

You've stumbled into my playground ‚Äî a little lab of controlled chaos.  
Firewalls, intrusion detection, DNS traps, packet sniffers ‚Äî all carefully designed to simulate madness in motion.

Some people just want to push packets.  
Me? I *watch the whole network burn,*  
then trace the ashes... with Suricata and Wireshark.

This is my profile.  
A place where defense meets deception.  
Where MITRE ATT&CK isn't just a framework ‚Äî it's a punchline.

Now, let‚Äôs put a smile on that DNS query.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

### **[Pi-hole + Unbound Recursive DNS Resolver](https://github.com/vlain-jkr/pi-hole-unbound)**
Built and configured a secure DNS resolver using Pi-hole and Unbound with DNSSEC validation and DNS-over-TLS fallback. Hardened the setup to act as a privacy-focused, recursive DNS layer for home or lab networks.

**Skills**: DNS security, DNSSEC, Unbound configuration, Pi-hole, Linux system administration

---

### **[Virtual SOC (Security Operations Center)](https://github.com/vlain-jkr/virtual-soc)**
Created a virtual SOC using Kali Linux and Ubuntu, with centralized log collection and basic SIEM simulation. The lab includes log forwarding, alert testing, and simulated incident response workflows.

**Skills**: Log analysis, SOC workflow, Linux networking, VM deployment, security operations

---

### **[Suricata + MITRE ATT&CK Mapping](https://github.com/vlain-jkr/suricata-mitre)**
Deployed Suricata IDS and mapped alert signatures to MITRE ATT&CK techniques. Designed and tested rule sets to detect common adversary behaviors in a lab network environment.

**Skills**: Intrusion detection, Suricata, rule writing, threat intelligence, MITRE ATT&CK

---

### **[Wireshark Threat Analysis Lab](https://github.com/vlain-jkr/wireshark-threat-lab)**
Used Wireshark to capture and inspect network traffic from simulated threats. Investigated suspicious activity such as port scans, lateral movement, and command-and-control traffic.

**Skills**: Packet analysis, network forensics, Wireshark filters, PCAP analysis, threat hunting

---

### **[Defense-in-Depth Simulation Lab](https://github.com/vlain-jkr/defense-in-depth-lab)**
Designed a layered security lab with network segmentation, firewall rules (iptables/nftables), and log obfuscation. Simulated attacker behavior to test the effectiveness of monitoring and controls.

**Skills**: Defense-in-depth, Linux firewalling, network segmentation, log management, red vs. blue simulation

## üë§ About Me

I'm **Gunveer Singh**, working under the handle **vlain-jkr** to explore the practical side of cybersecurity through open labs and research. I enjoy building realistic security environments and experimenting with ways to detect and prevent malicious behavior.

Feel free to explore the projects, fork the labs, or connect to collaborate.
